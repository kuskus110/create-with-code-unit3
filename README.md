# Forest Run
A small side-scrolling game, made with Unity, as a part of my game dev learing process.

<!-- [My game on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/) -->

## Description
I made this game as a part of the "[Create with code 2](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-3-sound-and-effects)" course on Unity Learn website.

I wrote the whole code by myself. I used the course's assets - models, sounds, animations, particles.

## Help me learn and improve
If you are an experienced Unity developer or C# developer, I would be very glad to recieve comments and review about my project and code. Help me learn :)
